## To briefly explain my days of *empty contributions*: are days where I solve *coding problems* and learn new *best practices* so I had nothing to commit. ✔
When stumbled upon challenge, in short my days are filled with:

1. Watching video/reading blog to improve my skills.
2. Writing notes & testing myself.
3. Re-watching video and compare it against my first understanding at step 2.
4. Modifying my notes.
5. Rinse and repeat step 3 & 4 for as long as it takes until "aha-moment". 👍
6. Doing more challenges.
7. Building project using my new skills.
